# Development Log

This log tracks the development process of the Epirus Showcase Agent. The agent will record its significant actions here to maintain state and allow for recovery.

## 2025-10-15

- **Action:** Initialized project environment for secure development.
- **Details:**
    - Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for a Python project to prevent committing unwanted files.
    - Created the `.env` file with a placeholder for the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to separate secrets from code.
- **Next Step:** Set up the Python virtual environment and install initial dependencies.

## 2025-10-15 (Part 2)

- **Action:** Completed initial infrastructure setup.
- **Details:**
    - Created a Python virtual environment at `.venv/`.
    - Installed initial dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`) into the venv.
    - Generated `requirements.txt` to lock dependency versions.
    - Created a minimal `main.py` with a basic FastAPI structure to verify the setup.
- **Next Step:** Develop the API endpoint (`POST /create-presentation`) as per the `tech_stack.txt` workflow.

## 2025-10-15 (Part 3)

- **Action:** Implemented the basic structure of the backend API endpoint.
- **Details:**
    - Added the `POST /create-presentation` endpoint to `main.py`.
    - Used Pydantic to define a `PresentationRequest` model that expects a `folder_path`.
    - The endpoint currently acknowledges the request and returns the provided path.
- **Next Step:** Implement the core logic for file reading and processing within the endpoint.

## 2025-10-15 (Part 4)

- **Action:** Implemented core content processing and summary generation.
- **Details:**
    - Enhanced `main.py` to read multiple file types: `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xlsx`.
    - Added the necessary libraries (`PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`, `openpyxl`) and updated `requirements.txt`.
    - Implemented the `generate_summary_with_gemini` function, which sends the aggregated file content to the Gemini API.
    - The LLM is prompted to create a structured Markdown summary, which is then saved as `summary.md` in the project folder.
- **Next Step:** Use the generated `summary.md` to create the final HTML presentation.

## 2025-10-15 (Part 5)

- **Action:** Implemented final presentation generation.
- **Details:**
    - Created the `generate_html_from_summary` function, which takes the `summary.md` file and uses Gemini to produce a full, single-page HTML presentation.
    - The function is prompted to create a modern, responsive design and to provide the HTML and CSS code separately.
    - The application now saves `index.html` and `style.css` to the project folder, completing the core backend pipeline.
- **Next Step:** Develop the frontend user interface to allow users to easily interact with the backend API.

## 2025-10-23

- **Action:** Added support for presentation files.
- **Details:**
    - Created `src/processors/presentation_processor.py` to handle `.pptx` files.
    - Installed `python-pptx` and added it to `requirements.txt`.
    - Integrated the new processor into `main.py`.
- **Next Step:** Continue with frontend development.
