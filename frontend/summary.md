### Building Documentation Project (DICRC)
*   **Focus:** Domestic architecture including local houses, palaces, havelis, bunglows, and buildings of religious importance, public, and commercial buildings that showcase high points in building crafts and varied construction techniques using wood, stone, and earth. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
*   **Documentation Categories:**
    *   Traditional and Vernacular Buildings
    *   Interior Architecture Elements (walls, floor, ceiling, roof, doors, windows, stairs, balconies, brackets, columns, parapets, entablatures)
    *   Furniture (bed, table, storage, chair, sofa, bench, stool, partition, swing)
    *   Objects and Accessories (carpets, light fixtures, frames, hardware)
*   **Methodology (Modus Operandi):**
    1.  **Primary Research:** Gathering existing records (drawings, photographs, literary accounts, historical documents) from archives, municipalities, institutions, museums, libraries, or private collections. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
    2.  **Primary Field Visit:** Reconnaissance survey, collecting information on building name, location, typology, construction techniques, relevant images, and maintaining a field trip diary. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
    3.  **Field Work:**
        *   **Field Drawings:** Detailed information on construction methodology, dimensions, and field notes, obtained through on-field measurements and historic documents. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
        *   **Photography:** Capturing context (streets, surroundings), spaces (internal), elevations, elements, details, interior architecture, furniture, objects, and accessories. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
        *   **Discussions:** Exploring history of houses and families, construction details, space usage changes, local rituals, practices, belief systems, myths, folklores, living/eating habits. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
    4.  **Post Fieldwork:**
        *   **Data Cataloguing and Digitization:** Compiling and digitizing drawings (architectural, interior architecture, furniture) and photographs systematically, including interviews. Converting field data into vector-based 2D, 3D, and exploded drawings. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
        *   **Preparation of Technical Drawings:** Creating site plans, floor plans, elevations, sections, and detailed drawings of construction techniques, interior, and furniture elements, including isometrics and exploded views. (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
        *   **Research and Analysis:** Analyzing documented data to interpret elements and associated Space Making Crafts (SMCs) and Surface Narrative Crafts (SNCs). (from BUILDINGDOCUMENTATIONvolumeI.pdf)
    5.  **Dissemination:** Through Traditional Building Portfolios (vector-based drawings), Building Element Manuals (detailed analysis of elements), Building Interactive Kits (online educational application with virtual tours and 3D models), TVB Lab (interactive drawing plate collection), Building Map (online map of documented houses), Fieldwork Reports, Publications (books, panels), Media (website, audio/video clips, 360-degree panoramas), and Exhibitions.

## Visual Information Analysis

### Image: img.jpg
This image effectively illustrates the transition from an architectural concept to a realized structure. It showcases a modern house design evolving from a detailed, linear architectural sketch on the left into a fully rendered, photorealistic 3D visualization on the right. The sketch highlights the geometric forms and structural ideas with crisp white lines against a light background. As the image progresses to the right, the house gains substance with smooth white facades, large glass panels, and dark architectural accents that add depth. The exterior includes a wooden deck leading to a reflective water feature, surrounded by landscaped greenery, including lawns and trees. A clear blue sky with a few clouds and a distant propeller plane completes the scene, conveying a sense of contemporary luxury and the complete lifecycle of an architectural project from design to detailed visualization.
