*   **Reasons for Extension:** The delay was deemed not to be the contractor's fault and was attributed to two main factors:
    1.  **Administrative Delays:** A significant delay in receiving approval for the necessary relocation of a critical pumping station (AB11) in the Kastrosykia area.
    2.  **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The global pandemic caused major disruptions, including significant delays in the procurement and delivery of materials, as well as difficulties in the movement of work crews and personnel from March 2020 onwards.
