*   **Building Documentation (DICRC):**
    *   To record, categorize, and disseminate information about Traditional and Vernacular Buildings and their elements (interior architecture, furniture, objects, accessories).
    *   To create a comprehensive data bank of Indian traditional and vernacular architecture and crafts.
    *   To act as a valuable educational resource for students, craftspeople, educators, design professionals, conservationists, and those in Art, Craft, Design, and Architecture.
    *   To document and analyze empirical knowledge systems, indigenous construction techniques, and innovative material usage.

## 6. Technical Description & Progress

### Astypalaia Central Square:

*   **Demolition of existing paving:** 6,200 m² (100% complete)
*   **Excavation – gravel layer:** 1,450 m³ (80% complete - 1,160 m³)
*   **Storm drain pipelines (HDPE Ø300 mm):** 480 m (60% complete - 290 m)
*   **Underground electrical lighting network:** 28 LED connection points (0% complete)
*   **New paving:** 6,200 m² with chiseled Paros stone slabs (7 cm thick, R11 anti-slip) (0% complete)
*   **Urban furniture:** 45 benches (70% recycled plastic), 12 waste bins, 6 Braille signs for people with disabilities.
*   **Planting:** 42 trees (oleanders, tamarisks) & 380 shrubs in special drainage zones (0% complete)
*   **Underground networks (DEH-OTE):** 1,180 m (0% complete)
*   **Problems Encountered:**
    *   Archaeological find (Roman aqueduct) delaying progress.
    *   Shortage of Paros stone slabs, leading to a search for an alternative supplier (Kavala, +8% cost).
    *   Increased cost of recycled plastic (22% increase), requiring a budget revision request of 38,400 €.

### Building Documentation (DICRC):

*   **Focus:** Domestic architecture (houses, palaces, havelis, bungalows), religious, public, and commercial buildings showcasing high points in building crafts and varied construction techniques (wood, stone, earth).
*   **Documentation Categories:** Traditional and Vernacular Buildings, Interior Architecture Elements (walls, floor, ceiling, roof, doors, windows, stair, balcony, column, parapet), Furniture (bed, table, storage, chair, sofa, bench, stool, partition, swing), Objects and Accessories (carpets, light fixtures, frames, hardware).
*   **Modus Operandi:**
    1.  **Primary Research:** Data collection from existing archives, publications, institutions (ASI, National Museum, universities), and resource persons.
    2.  **Primary Field Visit:** Reconnaissance surveys, collection of initial information and images, maintenance of field trip diary.
    3.  **Field Work:** Detailed field drawings (dimensions, construction methodology), photographic documentation (context, spaces, elevations, elements, details).
    4.  **Discussions:** Interviews with inhabitants and locals to understand history, construction details, usage changes, rituals, beliefs, living habits, and spatial design.
    5.  **Post Fieldwork:**
        *   Data Cataloguing and Digitization: Systematic compilation of drawings and photographs (architectural, interior architecture, furniture), cataloguing of interviews, conversion of field data into vector-based 2D, 3D, and exploded drawings.
        *   Preparation of Technical Drawings: Site plans, floor plans, elevations, sections, detailed drawings of interior and furniture elements, construction process exploded drawings.
        *   Research and Analysis: Interpretation of documented elements and associated Space Making Crafts (SMCs) and Surface Narrative Crafts (SNCs).
*   **Dissemination:**
    *   Traditional Building Portfolio (TBP): Vector-based drawings (plans, sections, elevations, details, interpretive drawings). DICRC has produced 4 TBPs (3 in Gujarat, 1 in Uttarakhand).
    *   Building Element Manual: Detailed analysis and interpretation of interior architecture and furniture elements, understanding embedded knowledge systems.
    *   Building Interactive Kit: Online educational application for virtual tours of buildings with 3D models, walkthroughs, and informative text, developed with Knownsense Studios.
    *   TVB Lab: Interactive collection of drawing plates from TBPs.
    *   Building Map: Online map showing documented and mapping-worthy houses with information filtered by materials and techniques.
    *   Publications: Fieldwork Reports, Panels, Books (e.g., "Prathaa: Kath-khuni architecture of Himachal Pradesh").
    *   Media: Website (http://himachal.crida.net/) with images, audio/video, 360-degree panoramas, 3D reconstructions.
    *   Exhibitions.

## 7. Visual Analysis of Images

The provided image does not directly relate to the "Revitalization of Astypalaia Central Square" or the "Traditional and Vernacular Buildings" projects in terms of showing actual construction status or specific architectural plans from those projects.

The image is a conceptual architectural rendering, partially completed as a sketch and partially rendered as a modern building.

*   **Image type:** Hybrid rendering (sketch + photorealistic).
*   **Architectural style:** Modern, minimalist, multi-story residence or commercial building.
*   **Key features:**
    *   Large glass windows and sliding doors, suggesting open-plan interiors and a connection to the outdoors.
    *   Multiple levels and cantilevered elements, creating a dynamic facade.
    *   Exterior living spaces, including a deck and what appears to be a pool or water feature.
    *   Lush landscaping, suggesting integration with nature.
    *   A vehicle (car) is partially visible in the background, providing scale and context.
*   **Construction Status (implied):** The hybrid nature of the image (partially sketched, partially rendered) could symbolically represent a project in the design or early planning phase, where ideas are still being finalized. It does not show actual physical construction progress.
*   **Architectural Plans (implied):** The image is an architectural visualization, which typically derives from detailed architectural plans, but it is not a plan itself. It shows the intended aesthetic and spatial arrangement.

This image would likely be used in a design proposal or a project conceptualization phase rather than a progress report for an ongoing construction project like the Astypalaia square, or documentation of existing traditional buildings.
