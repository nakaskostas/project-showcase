*   **Pre-approval for Extension:** Ειδική Υπηρεσία Διαχείρισης Ε.Π. Περιφέρειας Ηπείρου (Special Management Service O.P. Region of Epirus - Ε.Υ.Δ.Ε.Π.Π.Η.)

### Objectives
*   To execute works for the construction of a wastewater collection and disposal network within the Municipality of Preveza.
*   To construct pumping stations for the pressurized transfer of wastewater to the under-construction biological treatment plant.

### Technical Description
The project involves:
*   Construction of wastewater collection, transfer, and disposal networks.
*   Construction of pumping stations (e.g., AB11) for pressurized wastewater transfer.
*   The works include earthworks, building constructions, electromechanical installations, and communication testing for all pumping stations.
*   The pumping station AB11 is particularly significant for connecting the entire system.
*   The overall project covers the former Municipality of Zalongo (now Preveza) and the settlements of Loutsa & Loutsa beach in the Municipality of Parga.

#### Reasons for 1st Extension
The contractor requested an extension until 31-12-2021 due to:
*   **Delayed Approval for Pumping Station Relocation:** Non-approval of a modification to change the location of pumping station AB11 in the Kastrosykia area, despite the Municipality of Preveza's agreement. The approval was expected by May.
*   **Impact of Tourism:** The potential inability to start earthworks and construction for pumping station AB11 during summer months due to increased tourist traffic in the area.
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Significant delays in material procurement and delivery, as well as difficulties in personnel/crew movements, as per Article 60 of Law P.N.P. 20/03/2020 (regarding COVID-19).

The Directorate of Technical Works considered these reasons valid and not attributable to the contractor's fault. The Special Management Service of the O.P. Region of Epirus also provided a positive opinion for the extension.
